                <p>
                    We create fashion since 20 years, and today we produce vest for passion. Our men's vests are
                    designed for business and for leisure. Each model has a particular identity. Colors, shapes and
                    details are our must. Founders and the creativity are 100% proudly Italian, the feeling is for the
                    entire world.
                </p>

                <p>Our creations are produced in the beautiful and ancient city of Varna, on the Black Sea, in the East
                    side of Bulgaria, where the traditions are still alive and where the artisans have not lost the art
                    of craft.
                    Each piece of our collection is an handcraft job, all the parts of our vests are cut by hand and
                    sewed together in the most traditional way.
                    This is valid also for our fine white shirts and for our Panama hats.
                    Each piece of the collection is created for the client upon receipt of the order and personalized
                    with the embroidery.
                    For special occasion our vests will shine with our golden accessories.</p>
