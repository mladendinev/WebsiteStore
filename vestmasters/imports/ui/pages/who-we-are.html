                    We are two Italians designers, fan of creativity and glamoury style, who have been working for more than 20 years in the fashion business.
                    Few years ago we moved to Varna, magic and ancient Bulgarian city on the Black Sea, and here we have installed a laboratory of creativity in the heart of Odessos neighborhood where you can still breath an air of traditions and the love for the craft.
                    Creativity borns during long walks in the vast city park overlooking the sea and during stops in local restaurants, which serve delicate soft drinks on the beaches.
                    At Vest Masters, for our creations, we select only the best fabrics, with the noblest yarns and finishes of quality, using the best products on the market, most of them Made in Italy and in some cases also Made in Europe.
                    We never stop thinking: ideas born every day, to offer our customers new and unique products.
                    It is for this uniqueness and for craftsmanship that Vest Masters vests and all the accessories of the brand are limited in number. This depends on several factors. Just to name a couple, fabrics are created in limited edition for our brand and the raw material for our Panama hats is directly purchased from Panama producers.

                    Our products are not seasonal but annual. During the calendar year we present several capsule collections according to the season.
                    Vest Masters is a 2F Fashion Group trademark.
